# Tensorflow LSTM using Nietzsche
#### Satchel Grant - July 24, 2017

### Overview
The goal of this project was to familiarize myself with the inner workings of LSTMs using TensorFlow. The idea for using Nietzshe came from [Fast.ai](http://www.fast.ai/). Jeremey Howard uses this text to demonstrate how recurrent neural networks and LSTMs work. I enjoy Nietzsche's philosophies so I was curious to see what kind of blunt, existential truths the computer could generate. Disappointingly, much of the generated text does not make gramatical sense. A fun future project would be finding a way to enforce proper grammer.

This project includes 2 different scripts that employ LSTMs. One processes the data using characters whereas the other processes the text using full words. The text was tokenized using NLTK.
